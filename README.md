# Quagmire
This project, developed for CS203: Software Engineering, implements a web-based Tournament Management System designed for dual sports/games like chess, badminton, or tennis.

Quagmire is the go-to platform for arm wrestling fans, athletes, and event organisers. It's designed to make life easier for everyone involved in the sport. For players, it's a game-changer. You can quickly find tournaments that fit your schedule, and say goodbye to the hassle of repeatedly entering your details â€“ Quagmire remembers them for you. Tournament organisers will love how Quagmire takes the headache out of event management. With features like automatic draw generation, you can focus on running a great tournament instead of drowning in paperwork.
But Quagmire isn't just about convenience â€“ it's on a mission to grow Singapore's arm wrestling community. The app's friendly match feature using advanced matchmaking algorithms helps you connect with local opponents at your skill level and in your vicinity, so you're always challenged but never overwhelmed. And to keep you motivated, Quagmire celebrates your progress with achievements for hitting key milestones. It's all about nurturing your skills and passion for the sport.

## Introduction

Welcome to the G1T3's Quagmire. Our app is an arm wrestling tournament application that matches against each other using a sophisticated matchmaking algorithm.
This application is a full-stack solution that combines a Spring Boot backend with a Next.js frontend, orchestrated using Docker for easy development and deployment, (we will probably host it on AWS but not cfm)

### At a glance:
- Backend:
    - Java 17
    - Spring Boot 3.x
    - Spring Data JPA
    - Spring Security
- Frontend:
    - Next.js 13
    - React 18
    - TypeScript
- Database:
    - PostgresSQL 16.4
- DevOps:

    - Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 (for local development)
- Node.js 18 or later (for local development)
- npm or yarn (for local development)
- PostgreSQL 16.4

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ceewaigithub/g1-t3.git
     cd g1-t3
     ```

2. Configure environment variables:
    ```sh
    DB_USERNAME=postgres
    DB_PASSWORD=<insert-COMPLEX-password>

    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD
    POSTGRES_USER=$DB_USERNAME
    POSTGRES_DB=g1t3db
    PGUSER=$DB_USERNAME

    SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=$DB_USERNAME
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD
    SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/$POSTGRES_DB
    ```
    - Create a `docker.env` file in the root directory
    - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys)

    On your local machine:
    ```sh
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SPRINGBOOT_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend/ directory
    - Add the paths to your loopback addr.

3. Build and start the Docker containers:
     ```
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

## Running the Application

After completing the setup, you can access the application at:
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To stop the application, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, or run:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Development

### Backend Development
For local backend development:
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory
2. Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (or `mvn spring-boot:run` if you're not using the Maven wrapper)

### Frontend Development
For local frontend development:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`)

### Code Structure
- Follow the package structure as outlined in the [Project Structure](#project-structure) section.
- Organize backend code into layers: controllers, services, repositories, and models.
    - Controller: For REST controllers
    - Service: For business logic
    - Repository: For database interactions
    - Model: For entity classes
- Place cross-cutting concerns in the `common` package.

Here's a visual demonstration for the lazy folks:
- Make sure you have PostgreSQL running in the background.

^ After doing your local development, make sure your code compiles from **Docker** too

## Testing (WIP)
